## Motivation
- Stemming from the love of racing games and pixelated art style, Cyberacer is a pixelated racing game developed under the guidance of CP2106 Orbital - Independent Software Development Project. 
- By developing the game, we aim to bring joy and offer an engaging experience to casual gamers who enjoy retro racing games.
- We chose game development as the theme of our Orbital Project to pick up the skills and knowledge of Game Design,  C#, Unity 3D and Project Management with Git and GitHub, etc.
- Through the development process, we aim to practice software engineering skills that we have learnt so far â€” Object-Oriented Programming, User-Testing, Single Level of Abstraction Principle and Singleton Pattern, etc.
- Lastly, we aim to share the joy of game development!
