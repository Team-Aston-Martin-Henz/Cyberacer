## Motivation 🔥
1. Stemming from the love of racing games and pixelated art style, Cyberacer is a pixelated racing game developed under the guidance of CP2106 Orbital - Independent Software Development Project. 
2. By developing the game, we aim to bring joy and offer an engaging experience to casual gamers who enjoy retro racing games.
3. We chose game development as the theme of our Orbital Project to pick up the skills and knowledge of Game Design,  C#, Unity 3D and Project Management with Git and GitHub, etc.
4. Through the development process, we aim to practice software engineering skills that we have learnt so far — Object-Oriented Programming, User-Testing, Single Level of Abstraction Principle and Singleton Pattern, etc.
5. Lastly, we aim to share the joy of game development!

## Current Features 🎮
1. 24 Avaiable Vehicle.
2. 3 Tracks + 1 Practice Track.
3. Player VS Bot.
4. Lap Record + Best Lap Record.
