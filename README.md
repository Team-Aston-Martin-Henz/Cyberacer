## Motivation 🔥
Stemming from the love of racing games and pixelated art style, Cyberacer is a pixelated racing game developed for CP2106 Orbital - Independent Software Development Project. 

By developing the game, we aim to bring joy and offer an engaging experience to casual gamers who enjoy retro racing games. We would also like to pick up skills and knowledge related to game development, such as game design principles, C#, Unity, version control using Git and GitHub and more.

Through the development process, we aim to learn and apply software engineering practices. For example, object-oriented programming, user testing, single level abstraction principle, singleton pattern and etcetera.

Last but not least, we also want to simply have fun and enjoy the process of game development!

## Current Features 🎮
1. 24 avaiable vehicles
2. 3 tracks + 1 practice track
3. Player vs bot.
4. Lap time, total time and best lap time display
5. Pixelation of scene assets
6. Settings for gameplay
